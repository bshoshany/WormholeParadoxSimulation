# Simulation of time travel paradoxes using a wormhole time machine

The Mathematica notebook `WormholeParadoxSimulation.nb` provides a simulation of the time travel paradox model introduced in our paper **Wormhole Time Machines and Multiple Histories**. Please see the Mathematica notebook for basic information and the paper for detailed information.

Purchasing Wolfram Mathematica is **not** required to run the simulation. It can be viewed and interacted with using the freely available [Wolfram Player](https://www.wolfram.com/player/).
